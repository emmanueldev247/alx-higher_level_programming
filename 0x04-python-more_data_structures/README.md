# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

In this project, I've learned about fundamental data structures like sets and dictionaries. Sets, which store unique, unordered elements, are invaluable for set operations. Dictionaries, on the other hand, excel at key-value pair storage, making them ideal for quick lookups and associations. I've also delved into lambda functions and functional programming tools like map, reduce, and filter, enhancing my Python programming skills for various applications.
