In this repository, you'll find programs written for the higher-level programming track (started in Sprint 2) at [ALX Africa](https://twitter.com/alx_africa). These projects commenced during the 4th month of the Software Engineering program curriculum, where I am presently immersing myself in Python. Alongside Python, I've been actively strengthening and broadening my proficiency in C and shell scripting. The subsequent section outlines the projects included: _(would be updated as I push):_

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05. Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions)
* [0x06. Python - Classes and Objects](./0x06-python-classes)
