In this repository, you'll find programs written for the higher-level programming track (Sprint 2) at [ALX Africa](https://twitter.com/alx_africa). These projects commenced during the 4th month of the Software Engineering program curriculum, where I am presently immersing myself in Python. Alongside Python, I've been actively strengthening and broadening my proficiency in C and shell scripting. The subsequent section outlines the projects included: _(would be updated as I push):_

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
